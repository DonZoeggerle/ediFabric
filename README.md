# Archived
The last version of EdiFabric Framework before it was rewritten from scratch. 

It's been a long way. We started this project back on CodePlex, when it was still alive and kicking. Then moved it to GitHub, full of 
enthusiasm, and ready to help developers to easily adopt EDI. It was a mixed bag and unfortunately we had to abandon it 
due to the lack of interest and active contributors. We only had 5 contributors, to which we are very grateful. It's hard to maintain something as broad as EDI with limited resources. 

We have since worked on a commercial version of the framework that allowed us to entirely rework the code base and to
build a viable community around it. Surprisingly, we now have more active contributors than we ever had here. 
Paradoxical, isn't it.

Shortly after we decided to not support this repository we transferred ownership over it to another user and then contacted him\her, asking
to not publish the source code. Or something as ridiculous as that. What a massive howler that was. If we were able to go back in time, 
we would have done things differently. 

The outcry was daunting in a sense that there was none. Pretty disheartening. There was only a single user who actually went through 
the effort of creating a hard copy of this repository. We wish him well and promise to contribute whenever we have the time. Sadly,
this user refuses to add a link back to this original repository. 

Anyway, enough ranting, we thought it's appropriate to archive this repository with some explanation. 

BTW, EdiFabric/ediFabric is a trademark company name and not a product/repository name.
