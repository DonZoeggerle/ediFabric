<h3>One reference to bring them in, One line to parse them,<br>
One framework to find them all and in Object bind them.</h3>

We do not support the open source version anymore and this repository is left for reference only and as a response to the users who had created their own mirrors of EdiFabric without our permission. EdiFabric had been completely rewritten in the meantime to provide lightning fast performance, low memory usage and lean EDI processing without any intermediary steps. Please use this outdated version at your own risk and consider it completely different to the commercial version. 

We provide the best EDI tools for .NET, please visit our website for more information www.edifabric.com.
